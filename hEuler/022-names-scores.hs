-- Names scores
-- Problem 22
--
-- Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
-- containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
-- alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
-- multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a
-- name score.
--
-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which
-- is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
-- would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
--
-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
