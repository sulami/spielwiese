# cOneDimension

A proof of concept for a videogame using just one dimension.

### Setup

Run `make`. Needs a C compiler and ncurses headers.

### Instructions

You are the `O` in the middle. Kill the spawning `X`s by touching them with
the Danger Zoneâ„¢ around you without touching them with yourself. If you do, you
lose. Enemies will spawn faster over time.
