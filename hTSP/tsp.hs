-- The input data is taken from a friend's assignment and features six German
-- cities. The problem is the typical TSP, visit every city excactly once while
-- optimizing the total distance travelled. The start- and endvertex can be
-- chosen freely, but must be the same, so we get a Hamiltonian cycle. The
-- distance given is measured in kilometres and taken directly from the
-- assignment, so it might be factually wrong.

-- To represent the distances between the vertices, we will use a map of maps.
-- The city names do not use German umlauts for compability reasons (mainly
-- with my qwerty keyboard).
