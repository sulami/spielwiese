# pyGol

This is Conway's Game of Life, implemented in Python. This one is actually
complete.  It provides a class with various functions and methods to start the
game on random start screens.  Currently only running using Python 3, but the
only reason for this should be the print functions which I do not import from
\_\_future\_\_.

Have a look at the tests for use examples.
