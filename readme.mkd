# sulami/sulami-spielwiese // readme

This Repo is just my personal playground, containing a bunch of different
smaller projects, mostly coded in Python and C.

Most interesting might be the binary search tree implementations in both C and
Python, as well as Conway's Game of Life in Python. I also wrote a still
incomplete, Python-based music playlist manager named Codevibe.
