-- sulami/sulami-spielwiese // readme

This Repo is just my personal playgorund, containing a bunch of
different smaller projects, mostly coded in Python, Perl and Ruby.

You can download, study and use them, but they are usually
untested and written within some hours, so they are not meant to
be used in productive environments.
