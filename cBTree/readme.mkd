# cBTree

This is a simple Binarytree implementation in C. It provides some functions to
make binary search trees, look up values, delete keys and calculate overall
size and depth of a given tree. Duplicate keys are allowed and stored on the
left side.

As always, have a look at the tests for use examples.

Compiles with

    gcc

and whatever flags you like. Does also compile with

    clang

but for some reason does not get initialized with NULL on both leaves, so fails
the tests.
