# cBTree

This is a simple Binarytree implementation in C. It provides some functions to
make binary search trees, look up values, delete keys and calculate overall
size and depth of a given tree. Duplicate keys are allowed and stored on the
left side.

As always, have a look at the tests for use examples.

Compiles with

    clang --std=c99 -Weverything -O0
